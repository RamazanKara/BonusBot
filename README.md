# BonusBot

This is a bot for Discord, written in Java.  
It uses:  
* [Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J)  
* [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)  
* [Spotify-Web-API-Java](https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-java)  
* etc. (like Google API)


## What can the bot do?  

It can play audio from:
* YouTube  
* Spotify  
* SoundCloud  
* Bandcamp  
* Vimeo  
* Twitch streams  
* Beam   
* Local files  
* HTTP URLs  

More informations about the audio:  
[LavaPlayer GitHub](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer/tree/5019bd8173a0d8b99ff5fc53149774d77792702c)

Also it can manage the languages of the user.

If you understand a little bit of Java, you can add other languages by yourself (and maybe do a pull request).
