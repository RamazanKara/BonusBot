# BonusBot

This is a bot for Discord, written in Java.  
It uses LavaPlayer and Discord4J.  


## What can the bot do?  

It can play audio from:
* YouTube
* SoundCloud
* Bandcamp
* Vimeo
* Twitch streams
* Local files
* HTTP URLs  

More informations about the audio:  
[LavaPlayer GitHub](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer/tree/5019bd8173a0d8b99ff5fc53149774d77792702c)

Also it can manage the languages of the user.  
Currently supported are:  
* English
* German
* Turkish  

If you understand a little bit of Java, you can add other languages by yourself (and maybe do a pull request).

Oh and there is the command "8ball", just test it out.

## What is discordbot.conf?

There you have to change all the settings to be able to use the bot on your server.  
First of all you have to add your token.  
If you want to disable anything, just delete the settings or use "-1" for the value.  
But DON'T delete "token" and the "EmojiID" settings, these are important. 


## How can I use it?

### Download
First of all you have to download it.  
Head over to the releases-tab:
